                            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It has a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers. Despite being close to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet due to its lack of atmosphere. Mercury's surface is covered with craters from collisions with asteroids and comets. One of the most prominent features is the Caloris Basin, about 1,550 kilometers in diameter.
